Often, in a project you have some constants that you use often. Most of the time they can be string and can have some data associated with them. In those cases, creating constant for them helps. Java provides something called enum classes.

# enum Declaration

# enum instance methods

## boolean equals(Object obj)

## int compareTo(Object obj)

## String name(Object obj)

## int ordinal(Objec obj)

# static methods

## Object[] values()

## Object valueOf(String str)
