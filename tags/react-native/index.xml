Failed to execute the installDebug command in android. This problem happens mainly when your virtual device is running less on memory and is trying to install new build but failing because of insufficient storage.
To solve this -
Uninstall the previous build and try running build again. Wipe the data of virtual device You can do this by going to virtual device manager. Then Click vertical ellipsis symbol. Click on option to wipe data.</description></item></channel></rss>
